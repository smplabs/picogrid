To use Mathworks ThingSpeak to develop the cloud dashboard:
* Each ThingSpeak channel can store and display up to 8 fields. Create multiple channels per Pico board if more than 8 fields are needed.
* The write API keys of the channels need to be added to the embedded code for Pico boards to send data to the channel. 
* If Pico boards need to read data from channels, read API keys of the channels are to be added to the embedded code.
